# Declaration of Dependence

**This system depends on Echo Memory Governor for responsibility.**

---

## What This Means

ajt-grounded-extract is **structurally dependent** on Echo Memory Governor.

This is not a technical dependency.
This is an **ethical and architectural dependency**.

---

## The Dependence

grounded-extract depends on Echo Memory Governor for:

1. **Pending isolation** — Extract results become pending items (NOT memory)
2. **Negative Memory enforcement** — Forbidden content rejected at write boundary
3. **Approval requirement** — Human approval required before memory creation
4. **Rejection tracking** — All violations logged to trace

**Removing this dependency invalidates accountability claims.**

---

## What Breaks If Governor Is Removed

Without Echo Memory Governor:

❌ **Extracts become memory directly** — No pending layer
❌ **Forbidden content gets stored** — No Negative Memory enforcement
❌ **Auto-promotion returns** — No approval requirement
❌ **Rejections go untracked** — No audit trail

grounded-extract becomes **just another extraction system**.

---

## Why This Is a Declaration

This is not a README dependency note.
This is a **constitutional declaration**.

If you:
- Remove pending layer (extracts → memory directly)
- Bypass Negative Memory rules
- Add auto-approval logic
- Remove rejection tracking

**You are no longer running ajt-grounded-extract.**

You are running something else.

---

## What "Dependence" Means

### Technical Dependence (Normal)
- Library imports
- API calls
- Data formats

### Constitutional Dependence (This)
- **Memory permission structure**
- **Prohibition enforcement**
- **Approval boundary**

grounded-extract's **claim to be grounded** depends on governor.

Remove governor → Remove grounding claim.

---

## Integration Points

grounded-extract depends on:

1. **PendingStore** — Isolates extract results from memory
2. **NegativeMemoryEnforcer** — Rejects forbidden content
3. **MemoryWriter** — Requires approval tokens
4. **Trace logging** — Records all rejections
5. **Snapshot exclusion** — Pending never exposed to downstream systems

---

## What This Proves

This declaration proves:

1. **Extraction ≠ Memory** — Structurally enforced, not just documented
2. **Grounding requires boundaries** — Not just confidence thresholds
3. **Forbidden content cannot become memory** — Even with approval

---

## For Forks and Derivatives

If you fork ajt-grounded-extract:

### ✅ You MAY
- Improve extraction logic
- Add new structured schemas
- Optimize performance
- Change extraction strategies

### ❌ You MAY NOT (and still claim grounding)
- Write extracts directly to memory
- Bypass Negative Memory rules
- Add auto-approval logic
- Remove pending layer

If you remove the dependency:
- **Do not claim this is grounded**
- **Do not use the AJT name**
- **Do not reference this constitution**

---

## Grounding Is External

grounded-extract does NOT:
- Approve its own extracts
- Decide what becomes memory
- Override prohibition rules

grounded-extract DEPENDS on external systems:
- **Echo Memory Governor** for memory permission
- **Pending layer** for isolation
- **Human operators** for approval decisions

---

## Final Statement

**This system depends on Echo Memory Governor for responsibility.**

Not for convenience.
Not for features.
For **the ability to claim extracts are grounded, not automatic**.

**Removing this dependency invalidates accountability claims.**

**Repository:** ajt-grounded-extract

**Constitution:** Echo Judgment Constitution v1.0
